# About

Hey, I'm Henry Glendening and have been building software professionally since 2012. I first started coding on a TI-83+ calculator when I was 12 and have continued my curiosity for and interest in building software ever since.

Much of my career so far has been focused on building mobile apps, from greenfield code to large-scale applications with millions of users. I enjoy working with clean architecture, deliberate UX, and shipping things that directly improve people's lives in a tangible way.

Lately, I've been digging into prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, and how AI tools fit into the SDLC. I'm currently running a research project called Human Touch, which has so far involved 500+ LLM invocations, blind evaluation protocols, and some late nights trying to figure out how to get AI to produce solutions demonstrating ingenuity. More to come on that soon!

This site is where I write about what I'm learning. Expect posts about AI evaluation, agentic engineering, mobile development, and whatever else I'm curious about.
